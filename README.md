Introduction//
Those R code are for estimating total suspended solids (TSS) concentration from remote sensing data

There are two folders including code for:
(1) MERIS, OLCI image
(2) MSI image

in each folder, there are example input/output files, which can be used to test running the code
#
#
# 
How to use//
(1) copy all the files from Github to your computer;
(2) open the R file "Run_code_to_get_TSS.R", change the working directory to the path you save the code;
(3) save your input file (either csv or tiff file) in the same folder;
(4) run the code "Run_code_to_get_TSS.R" to get TSS results.
